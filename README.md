## Description

Passionate Photography is personal blog site for the fictional photographer Christopher Duvall. The site is coded using HTML and vanilla Javascript, and is styled using regular CSS. The site consists of a homepage, a page for blog posts, pages for specific posts, an about page and a contact page.

The content for the website is stored on a WordPress installation used as a headless CMS, taking advantage of the WordPress REST API to fetch the data.

This project was an exam from Noroff's Frontend course first year and was delivered in May 2021. The time frame was 5 weeks, and the assignment requirements are listed in the next section.

## Assignment requirements:

### Homepage:

The home page should have a ‘Latest Posts’ section which uses a carousel (slider) for users to click to view more posts. For example, by default the user can see four posts, then they can click an arrow on the right to view the next four posts, and click it again to view the next four posts. The user can also click back to view results they had previously seen.

### Blog page:

The website should have at least 12 blog posts. The blog posts page should show the first 10 blogs, and the user should click to view more results which then show underneath the first 10 blogs.

### Blog specific page:

The content of the blog specific page should be dynamically built using a query string parameter based on whatever link the user clicked. The title of the blog specific page should change based on the blog that has been clicked on e.g. “My Blog | An Article I Wrote”.
If images on the blog post page are clicked, a modal should appear giving the user a bigger view of that image. Clicking outside the image should hide the modal.

### Contact page:

Create a contact us page, there should be 4 text boxes on this page:
-	Name (Should be more than 5 characters long)
-	Email address (Must be a valid email address)
-	Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long)
-	Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long)

Please use JavaScript for validation, show error messages if the values in the text boxes do not meet the requirements.
